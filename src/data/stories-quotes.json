If you wanted to do something and didn’t know how to do it, there was definitely people you could talk to that would help you learn how. HackBeanpot had a lot of people just giving talks about things in computer science that people may want to learn, and I feel like that was really cool because it was so easy to learn and pick up new things.",

To the team that would mean making sure our team is inclusive of everyone’s opinions and perspectives… To the event I think diversity is important for encouraging people who don’t necessarily see themselves at a hackathon to participate and try something new.",
